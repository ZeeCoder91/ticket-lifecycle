<p>
Make sure to login in as a help desk professional in order to troubleshoot and solve the helpdesk tickets. We can see that all the tickets are defaulted to normal and there is no clear priority. Notice how the tickets are assigned to a helpdesk agent, usually a queue manager or a helpdesk lead will go through all of the tickets and assign them appropriately.</p>

<p>
Taking the role of helpdesk lead, let's go through the ticket: In the ticket thread we read, "Customers are reporting they are getting a 404 error when trying to browse to online banking". This is a high priority ticket because it is a business impacting problem. It's not good that the entire online banking system is down.</p>

</p>
<br />

<p>
Let's change the ticket from 'normal' to 'emergency' because it will impact the organization.</p>
<p>

</p>
<br />

<p>
Since this is a high priority, business impacting problem, we will assign the ticket to the queue manager or the escalation engineer.</p>
<p>

</p>

<p>
We want to make sure the SLA is set to match the severity of the problem.</p>

<p>
It's quite likely that the Support Department wouldn't be authorized to troubleshoot this ticket because it appears to be a system problem, so we'd assign this ticket to the System Administrators Department.</p>

<p>
As we see there is a history of all the actions made on this ticket.</p>
<p>

</p>
<br />

<p>
There is a response and internal note field to record solutions, follow ups and additional notes on the ticket.</p>
<p>

<br />

<p>
We can see some of the changes we implemented on the ticket from the agent panel.</p>
<p>

<p>
After a solution has been reached, we can follow up with the client and close the ticket.</p>
