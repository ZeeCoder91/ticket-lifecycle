<br />

<p>
Log in as a help desk professional to address and resolve tickets. Initially, tickets default to a 'normal' priority without clear distinction. A queue manager or helpdesk lead typically reviews and assigns these tickets to the appropriate agent for resolution.</p>

<p>
As a helpdesk lead, assess the ticket detailing customer reports of a 404 error when accessing online banking. Given the business impact of an inaccessible online banking system, categorize this as a high-priority issue requiring immediate attention.</p>
